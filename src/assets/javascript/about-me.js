    'I am an electronics engineer and software developer by profession, but I have a very diverse range of interests and hobbies. I am an adventurer by heart, and  am constantly trying to push the boundaries of my horizons. Whether it be exploring new cities, climbing new mountains or surfing new waves, the thrill of adventure always seems to fill me with a sense of contentment like nothing else can. In my spare time I am also an aspiring creative. Photography, website design, painting, sketching, writing. The list goes on.',
    'I love to live life differently, in whichever way I can. I challenge myself everyday to find new pathways to explore, and new directions to follow. Seeing the journeys and experiences of others inspires me to do greater things everyday. Thus, I write this blog in hopes of inspiring others out there to appreciate life to itâ€™s fullest, in whatever way is truest to them.',
