      'I haven’t always been a traveller. That’s actually quite an understatement. Before the beginning of this year, I had never travelled outside of South Africa. Well, not entirely true either. My parents travelled to a few places with me when I was younger, but I was much too young to appreciate the experience, nor do I remember much from it now. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the year, with just about no travelling experience, I made the decision to move to Paris, to throw myself into a new adventure filled with new cultures, histories and languages. And thus, my very first travelling expedition began.',
      'Being in a new city so completely different from home is isolating in so many ways. Interacting can reach levels of difficulty and complexity that you didn’t even know were possible. Between the language barriers and cultural differences, one can quickly feel as though their understanding of social norms had broken down entirely and even more so, your perception of human emotions becomes largely distorted. It makes for very interesting interactions when you realise you have little to no social intuition. You find yourself questioning almost everything you do during a simple exchange. Occasionally, even something as trivial as ordering a coffee at a local cafe becomes a difficult and, at times, even an unpleasant experience.',
      'Despite all of these unfamiliarities and potential unpleasantries, I have found the most of these experiences to be friendly and entertaining and sometimes even enlightening. I often treat these little exchanges as fun ways to practice my (very poor) French. It’s a funny thing walking into a bakery and simply ordering a baguette, only to be absolutely assaulted with the French language in response. There is not much more one can do but smile dumbly and say “Désolé, je comprand pas”. The experience of interacting with people of different languages and cultures can teach you so much. Slowly but surely, your social intuition redefines itself. With a little bit of patience, you begin to adapt and to understand.',
      'Of course, with new places also comes new found knowledge. Through exploration and interaction, you learn and grow in more ways than you thought possible. As you begin to learn about new cultures and different histories, they impart on you a new found understanding and appreciation of the world and in the process of gaining better understanding of the world, so to you gain a better understanding of yourself, who you are and who you want to be. It is in these fleeting moments, filled with bursts of knowledge and emotions, that the boundaries of all that is you, your mind, heart and soul, are stretched to their limits. It is truly a marvellous and somewhat paradoxical process: the constant and occasionally violent clashing of emotions which bring about a deep sense of tranquillity and contentment. As far as my experience goes, there are few feelings quite like it.',
      'Needless to say, the sensation of moving halfway across the world when you haven’t ever set foot outside of your home country is a very foreign one indeed. A somewhat indescribable mixture of thoughts and feelings all swirling around inside both your head and heart. The sadness of saying goodbye, the fear of the unknown, the deep loneliness that comes with unfamiliarity, the excitement of new horizons. All of these and more swirling around every minute of everyday. In any one moment they can be tearing you apart and the next, flooding you with endless hope and elation. It is as though one was caught a drift on a raft, in an ocean of ever changing and unpredictable tides. Fight it, and it becomes agonising, unbearable, potentially even hopeless. But accept it, and it becomes freeing, exhilarating and soulful. Fortunately I cannot quite say that I have ever been stuck on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Nevertheless, the experience of setting yourself adrift on the tides of the world is a momentous one indeed and I cannot say that I’ll ever look back.',

      'Learning can be a difficult process. It requires a certain mindset, a kind of patience and acceptance as well as a strong sense of determination. This mindset is by no means easy to come by, particularly in the modern world where information is so readily available at our fingertips. People want things done and want to know things now. In this kind of fast paced world it is so easy to lose sight of the values so crucial to learning. There is so much drive towards the end goal and results, that we often forget to enjoy the process of learning and all of it’s beauty.',
      'The extreme pursuit of results creates a kind of instant gratification mindset which is so counter productive to true learning. At so many educational institutions, schools and universities alike, there is a very large value placed on the results you achieve. This emphasis creates what I consider to be an extremely detrimental psychological association between good results and intelligence or ability. Those who never manage to achieve good results are reduced into thinking they are not capable of understanding, and those who do very well are often fooled into thinking they do.',
      'Perhaps this may sound rather bizarre, surely it is safe to assume someone with excellent, or at least good results, has understood and really absorbed the content of a course? From my personal experience, this is all too often not the case. As someone who managed to achieve fairly above average results at university, I know that there are many courses I excelled at despite never truly developing a solid foundation of the course content. As such, the knowledge of those courses was lost almost immediately after completion. I know that I am not alone in this, having several friends and colleagues who also excelled at university despite often never really coming to grips with the content of many courses. On the other end of the spectrum, I have also seen many friends and classmates who finished with a poor result, or at times even failed, despite having a very clear understanding and in depth knowledge of a courses content.',
      'I will leave the debate on this kind of educational system for another day, as it is an extremely complex topic and one that I have far too many opinions about. However, one thing that is for certain, is that the kind of mentality introduced by this set of values, that places such a large emphasis on the end result, is a highly detrimental one to the process of learning. This became particularly evident to me after university when I no longer had any results to affirm my ability. Outside of university, I was so convinced I would do so many things. I started many personal projects and hobbies. None of those first few projects ever made it to completion and it became increasingly difficult to even start projects of any form, let alone finish them. It was incredibly difficult for me to understand because I was so used to excelling that I could not quite comprehend why I could not manage any of these projects, many of which were not particularly difficult.',
      'It was after many many failed attempts that I came to realise that slowly but surely, I had destroyed my own false sense of confidence bestowed upon me by my university results. When there were no results to affirm my ability, It was extremely difficult, if not impossible to tackle challenging projects, no matter how interesting. The results that I so heavily relied on for motivation were no longer there. The yardstick for success had disappeared altogether. Without any sense of success or ability, motivation was far too often compromised by the prevailing sense of self-doubt and inability. In a fairly short period of time, this destructive mindset had reduced my once confident and motivated mind into one full of self-doubt and insecurity.',
      'Getting rid of this mindset was by no means an easy process. Having had it ingrained in me  throughout my entire educational career, it was something deeply rooted within the way I took on new challenges and projects. However, rid myself of it I did. It took a long period of time and a lot of conscious effort, but I slowly, truly learnt what it means to learn something, or at least, my own definition of what it meant to me. And when I say learn, I am not just talking about studying from a book. I mean any form of activity that requires some kind of ability: painting, dancing, surfing, flying a plane; you get the point.',
      'I know now that it was this results oriented mindset that caused my ego to get in the way of appreciating what I was doing. When I perceived myself to be not good at something, I instantly began to grow frustrated and demotivated with my lack of ability, instead of enjoying myself. I managed to shed this mindset by changing my definition of success. I realised that in not knowing something, you have outstretched in front of you a potential path of wonder and self improvement.   I just needed to be patient enough to understand and accept that the path of self improvement was long and often tough and certainly not something to be rushed.',
      'It is from this patience, understanding and acceptance that I have learnt so much more than just, well, learning. I have developed a mindset that has allowed me to do things I have never done before, to go places I have never gone before. All from the small realisation that being bad at something isn’t necessarily a bad thing and perhaps more importantly, adopting a mindset which sees excitement and a potential to learn rather than frustration and inability.  This small mindset may seem simple enough, but it can be extremely difficult to adopt and requires a very large amount of mental energy and conscious effort every single day.',
      'The fact is, true learning takes time. It takes patience, motivation and real determination. The purpose of learning should not be the end result, not to say that the end result isn’t important. Often you are undoubtedly going to want to apply that knowledge somewhere, but the value of learning lies within the process. There is so much more to learn through the process of learning than just the content you are trying to absorb. It requires an overcoming of ones ego and insecurities, it gives a sense of determination and self pride. It gives you the ability to tackle things far greater than you originally thought possible of yourself, because you are no longer looking at the height of the peak you are trying to climb, but rather enjoying the beauty of the landscape surrounding you,q as you venture upwards and onwards. It gives you a kind of solemn acceptance of the fact that you do not know. Even more so, it gives you an enthusiasm for the realisation that not knowing simply means you have yet another exciting adventure ahead.'
